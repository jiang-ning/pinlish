            <h3>Story</h3>
            <p>In July 2007, Dalian China, three young man - Sawyer, John and Kevin joined IBM and they became very good friends since they were met at the onboard days.</p>
            <p>Eveything is fresh for them, They help each other, they talk about everything in tea time, they working with great colleagues from United States, HongKong, France, Netherlands, Slovakia, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, India and of course most of China.</p>
            <p>Kevin leaved IBM in 2014 and joined other company, Sawyer and John stayed on even their department was acquired became to Concentrix in 2015, but three guys still keep in touch frequently just like old times. They remembering all the projects they've worked before - Samsung, Nokia, Panasonic, Hyundai, Castrol, Tiffany, Pfizer, A&F and Uber.</p>
            <p>One weekend day in 2017, Sawyer and John told Kevin that they found a very interesting things while a working day's break time, that use the pronounce of Chinese Pinyin to speak English words, for example what "IBM" speak by Pinyin should be "Yi Bo Mo", said by the inventor Sawyer - this is definitely a joking that just for fun which he used to be like always. they all laughed. Kevin got an idea and told to them in fact this is not quite useless at all, because it sounds so weird and science fiction movies or TV series might need alien's talk, just like &lt;&lt;Star Wars&gt;&gt;, some of people might like it.</p>
            <p>Sawyer and John accepted Kevin's proposal, and Kevin built a website with a simple introduction page for it after few days, they call it "Pinlish" - words "Pinyin" mixed "English". The site planed to have more functionalities in the future.</p>
            <p>September 1st, 2017, Sawyer was gone.</p>
            <p>Kevin back to Concentrix with low salary, to hold a memorial ceremony for Sawyer, and also the lost youth.</p>
            <p>After one year the Website Pinlish is no longer maintain and finally closed by the server's vendor. no one care about it.</p>
            <p>Time passed to May 2021, the methodology for translate English to Pinyin, has popped into Kevin's mind, he told John this idea and ready to rebuild the website with preconceived translation and read Pinlish. After a month's working, Pinlish published online. For Sawyer.</p>
